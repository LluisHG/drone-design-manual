	Abstract = {This paper presents an optimization of the voltage doubler stages in an energy conversion module for Radio Frequency (RF) energy harvesting system at 900 MHz band. The function of the energy conversion module is to convert the (RF) signals into direct-current (DC) voltage at the given frequency band to power the low power devices/circuits. The design is based on the Villard voltage doubler circuit. A 7 stage Schottky diode voltage doubler circuit is designed, modeled, simulated, fabricated and tested in this work. Multisim was used for the modeling and simulation work. Simulation and measurement were carried out for various input power levels at the specified frequency band. For an equivalent incident signal of --40 dBm, the circuit can produce 3mV across a 100 k? load. The results also show that there is a multiplication factor of 22 at 0 dBm and produces DC output voltage of 5.0 V in measurement. This voltage can be used to power low power sensors in sensor networks ultimately in place of batteries.},

	Abstract = {Smartdust is the evolution of wireless sensor networks to cubic centimeter dimensions or less. Smartdust systems have advantages in cost, flexibility, and rapid deployment that make them ideal for many military, medical, and industrial applications. This work addresses the limitations of prior works of research to provide sufficient lifetime and performance for Smartdust sensor networks through the design, fabrication and testing of a novel low power receiver for use in a Smartdust transceiver. Through the novel optimization of a multi-stage LNA design and novel application of a power matched Villard voltage doubler circuit, a 1.0 V, 1.6 mW low power On-Off Key (OOK) receiver operating at 2.2 GHz is fabricated using 0.13 um CMOS technology. To facilitate data transfer in adverse RF propagation environments (1/r^3 loss), the chip receives a 1 Mbps data signal with a sensitivity of -90 dBm while consuming just 1.6 nJ/bit. The receiver operates without the addition of any external passives facilitating its application in Smartdust scale (mm^3) wireless sensor networks. This represents an order of magnitude decrease in power consumption over receiver designs of comparable sensitivity. In an effort to further extend the lifetime of the Smartdust transceiver, RF power harvesting is explored as a power source. The small scale of Smartdust sensor networks poses unique challenges in the design of RF power scavenging systems. To meet these challenges, novel design improvements to an RF power scavenging circuit integrated directly onto CMOS are presented. These improvements include a reduction in the threshold voltage of diode connected MOSFET and sources of circuit parasitics that are unique to integrated circuits. Utilizing these improvements, the voltage necessary to drive Smartdust circuitry (1 V) with a greater than 20% RF to DC conversion efficiency was generated from RF energy levels measured in the environment (66 uW). This represents better than double the RF to DC conversion efficiency of the conventional power matched RF energy harvesting circuit. The circuit is integrated directly onto a 130 nm CMOS process with no external passives and measures only 300 um by 600 um, meeting the strict form factor requirement of Smartdust systems.},

	Abstract = {Contactless Energy Transfer (CET) describes the process in which electrical energy is transferred among two or more galvanically isolated electrical circuits or devices by means of magnetic induction (magnetic energy). The potential applications can range from the transfer of energy between low power home and office devices to high power industrial systems. Medical, marine, and other applications where physical electrical contact might be dangerous, impossible or at the very least problematic, are all prospective candidates for using CET. The work in this thesis mainly concentrates on fundamental concepts of a CET system that consists of multiple PCB inductors arranged to form a platform surface. When a mobile electronic device, embedded with a similar "power receiving" inductor, is placed on the platform surface, power is transferred from the platform to the mobile device through magnetic induction. Small low profile air-cored PCB inductors are used, since they can easily and cheaply be produced, and due to the small size and low profile easily be embedded in different devices without adding much weight or volume to the existing designs. As such, the CET platform attempts to remove the different cables, plugs and adaptors used to power and recharge various mobile electronic devices. Firstly, a library of analytical and numerical methods and procedures for modeling planar inductors constructed as copper tracks on printed circuit boards are presented. Here methods for calculating the DC- and AC-resistances, mutual inductances, selfinductances, magnetic field intensity, and parasitic capacitances are developed. Using these models, the maximum excitation frequency of the inductors are estimated in respect to their self-resonating frequencies. The purpose of this "library of techniques" is not only to model the inductors used in this work, but to act as a single repository for information on modeling similar planar PCB inductors for various future CET applications. The developed models are verified through measurements and FEM simulations, and they all show good agreement. Secondly, the development of the theory and the synthesis of a variable-phase CET system is performed. The platform is designed, based on user requirements, to transfer approximately 8 W of power from a cluster of three primary windings to a load connected to the secondary winding, over a 5 mm air gap. In this way about 5 W is available to load devices connected to the secondary winding and circuit after rectification and down conversion. The primary inductor platform consists of a matrix of hexagon spiral windings with radii of 12.5 mm, while the secondary windings have radii of 20 mm. The system operates at a frequency of 2.777 MHz, and is designed to induce a minimum voltage of 10 V (RMS) in the secondary winding, in order to ensure that at least 5 V - 6 V DC is available to the load devices. The CET platform is implemented in a prototype system. This high-frequency power electronic system is modularly designed and consists of several subsystems including a FPGA controller, quadratic buck converters, high-frequency half-bridge MOSFET drivers, half-bridge inverters, voltage and current estimators, as well as winding commutation circuits. Thirdly, in order for the CET system to locate the valid devices placed on the platform, an innovative load detection scheme is developed. The load detection scheme "scans" the primary windings while estimating their equivalent impedances through measurements. By comparing and detecting diffrences between the measurements and previously calibrated values, the system can find and locate the valid devices. Furthermore, this process has the added advantage of being able to distinguish between valid CET devices, metallic materials, as well as soft-magnetic materials placed on the platform surface. Objects like, soft-drink cans, lighters, pens, coins, and certain softmagnet containing devices, which might have been accidently placed on the platform, can thus be detected, and the activation of the windings closest to it, avoided. Fourthly, the CET platform investigates the effciency of a novel stray magnetic field shielding methodology using destructive wave interference. In contrast to the more conventional methods of shielding using magnetic- and conductive materials, this method uses the amplitudes and phases of the currents in the primary windings, to alter the distribution of the magnetic field above the windings, resulting in a reduction of the stray magnetic field. The system is designed to operate in one of three modes: single-phase, three-phase and variable-phase mode. During single-phase mode, all activated primary windings are excited with in-phase currents. Here, no additional reduction of the magnetic field is expected. During three-phase mode, the primary windings are excited with currents of equal amplitude but with 120 degrees phase shifts. Here, the magnetic fields of the three primary windings undergo destructive wave interference, attenuating the stray magnetic field. During power transfer, however, the secondary winding current still contributes to the field in a constructive manner. The variable-phase operational mode attempts to further reduce the stray field by taking into account the current in the secondary winding during power transfer. Here, the windings inside the activated winding cluster are excited with precalculated currents of different amplitudes and phases, which will give the minimum stray magnetic field values for given secondary winding placements and power transfer levels. The simulation results show that both the threephase and variable-phase modes are able to reduce the stray magnetic fields (for the same amount of power transferred to the load resistor) compared to the single-phase mode. Attenuation results of up to 12 dB are calculated. Finally, the power transfer capability, the operation of the load detection scheme, and the stray magnetic field shielding through destructive wave interferences are all verified through measurements performed on the prototype system. Furthermore, the prototype system is able to transfer 5 W of power (DC) to a load connected to the secondary circuit, in all three operational modes, and all measurement results show good agreement with calculated values.},

	Abstract = {A novel wireless power driving and controlling system is proposed, which is based on the electrical driving and controlling characteristic of liquid crystal micro-lens array with tunable focal length. The system consists of two isolated circular copper stacked coils with circular cross section. Both of coils are air-cored. The big one, used to generate electromagnetic field, has the wire diameter of ~1mm, and the coil diameter of ~38mm and the height of 10mm. By contrast, the small one, used to produce electromotive force by induction effect, is ~1mm, ~13mm and ~18mm, respectively. The varying electromotive force is generated in the small coil by the variable intensity of magnetic field resulting from changing the time of current through the big coil. The agreement of experimental results with the theoretical analysis proves that the electromotive force can be continuously changed from 0 to 30Vrms (root mean square), when the duration of current through the big coil is reasonablely selected. It is very important that the clear image can be got and the image quality of liquid crystal micro-lens array can be comparable to that of conventional optical micro-lens array.},

Via detailed theoretical and numerical analyses of typical real-world model-situations and realistic material parameters, we establish that such a non-radiative scheme can lead to ``strong coupling'' between two medium-range distant such states and thus could indeed be practical for efficient medium-range wireless energy transfer. },

@phdthesis{meyer,
	Abstract = {In the domain of electronic devices and especially
                     desktop peripherals, there is an industrial trend
                     which consists in removing the cables that pollute
                     our domestic and professional environments. In this
                     sense, wireless communication protocols are already
                     massively widespread while the power supplies still
                     use wires or batteries. To address this problem,
                     alternative solutions must be investigated such as
                     contactless energy transfer (CET). In a broad sense,
                     CET is a process that allows to bring electrical
                     energy from one point to another through a given
                     medium (generally air or vacuum) and at a certain
                     distance. Inductive CET means that the intermediate
                     form of energy is the magnetic induction, generated
                     from primary coils excited by high-frequency
                     alternating currents and collected in secondary coils
                     by induced voltages. Most of existing approaches to
                     design CET systems are applicable to only single
                     applications and do not include an optimization
                     method. For this reason, the present thesis focuses
                     on the modeling, design and optimization of inductive
                     CET systems. Using the coreless transformer as the
                     central part of CET systems, an equivalent electric
                     model is derived from the theory of conventional
                     transformers. The absence of ferrite core gives rise
                     to a specific characteristic, which is to have large
                     leakage inductances compared to the main one. In
                     order to circumvent this issue, using a high
                     frequency together with a resonant circuit allow to
                     enhance the effect of the mutual inductance and to
                     transfer power with an excellent efficiency.
                     Different parts of the coreless transformer are
                     addressed separately. First, an accurate modeling of
                     DC resistances, self and mutual inductances is
                     proposed. Then, the equivalent electric circuit is
                     resolved and the different compensation topologies
                     for the resonant circuit are discussed. Finally, the
                     AC resistance is computed using a 2D finite element
                     modeling that takes into account the skin and
                     proximity effects in the conductors. So as to exploit
                     optimally FEM simulations, a complete output mapping
                     together with a specific interpolation strategy are
                     implemented, giving access to the AC resistance
                     evaluation in a very short time. As a result, all the
                     models are implemented in a way that makes them
                     highly adaptable and low-consuming in term of
                     computing resources. Then a sensitivity analyzis is
                     performed in order to restrict the variation range of
                     different parameters and to provide a general and
                     intuitive understanding of inductive CET. After that,
                     an optimization method using genetic algorithms (GAs)
                     is presented. The main advantage of GAs is that the
                     number of free parameters does not change the
                     complexity of the algorithm. They are very efficient
                     when a lot of free parameters are involved and for
                     optimizations where the computing time is a key
                     factor. As existing GAs failed to converge properly
                     for different tested CET problems, a new one is
                     developed, that allows to optimize two objective
                     functions in the same time. It is thus a
                     multiobjective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and has been
                     successfully applied to the design of different CET
                     systems. Finally, in order to validate the models and
                     optimization methods proposed along the thesis,
                     several prototypes are built, measured and tested.
                     Notably, a CET table that allows to supply
                     simultaneously different peripherals is fabricated.
                     By analyzing in real time the current amplitude in
                     the primary coils, an efficient sensorless detection
                     of the peripherals is implemented. Digital control
                     techniques have enabled the autonomous management of
                     the detection and the local activation of the table.
                     These results contribute to the future development of
                     robust and efficient CET tables.},
